		<h3>Developer skills</h3>
		<p>
			I write safe code in any language and I prefer the most suited langauge for each task. However, I am especially adept in Go and I have followed its progression since 2012.
		</p>
		<p>
			During my free time I usually write code for fun and I have written a few projects, for example:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>the Markdown to HTML micro-service for our student chapters web page,</li>
			<li>co-authored a flac audio decoding library for the Go community,</li>
			<li>lots of 3D-visualization programs for recreational renders of fractals,</li>
			<li>the backend infrastructure for a cloud-based, deep learning powered, image analysis project.</li>
		</ul>
